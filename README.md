## What is DVC?
DVC (Data Version Control) is an open-source version control system for machine learning projects. It allows you to version and manage data and code together, and track the dependencies between them. DVC helps with reproducibility and collaboration in ML projects by allowing you to track changes to data and code, and easily share and reproduce experiments. It is similar to Git, but is specifically designed for data and machine learning projects.
